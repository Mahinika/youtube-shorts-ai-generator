# PyTorch GPU Fix - APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY âœ…

## Issue
Stable Diffusion was running 50-100x slower than expected (115-210 seconds per step instead of 1-3 seconds).

## Root Cause
**PyTorch was not installed in the virtual environment**, even though it was listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Fix Applied
Installed PyTorch with CUDA 12.1 support:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

## Verification Results
- âœ… PyTorch 2.5.1+cu121 installed
- âœ… CUDA 12.1 detected
- âœ… GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (6GB)
- âœ… Matrix multiplication: 0.09s (100 iterations)
- âœ… Stable Diffusion loading: 2.4s
- âœ… Image generation (1 step): 0.8s

## Expected Performance Now
- **Before**: 28-52 minutes per image (15 steps)
- **After**: 30-60 seconds per image (15 steps)
- **Speedup**: 50-100x faster! ðŸš€

## Date Applied
October 15, 2025

## Note
If you reinstall packages or create a new virtual environment, make sure to install PyTorch with GPU support using the command above, not just from requirements.txt.
