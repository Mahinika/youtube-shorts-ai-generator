"""
ULTRA FAST BACKGROUND GENERATION

Modified version of step3 that only generates 2 scenes instead of 3.
This is the companion file for ULTRA FAST mode.

To use: Backup your original step3_generate_backgrounds.py, 
then replace line 68 with the optimization below.
"""

# ULTRA FAST OPTIMIZATION
# In steps/step3_generate_backgrounds.py, line 68:

# Change from:
#     optimized_scenes = scene_descriptions[:3]

# To:
#     optimized_scenes = scene_descriptions[:2]  # ULTRA FAST: Only 2 scenes

# This reduces AI generation time by ~33% (from 3 scenes to 2 scenes)
# While still maintaining visual variety

print("""
