# Story Mode Guide

## üéØ Problem Solved

You were getting unwanted facts and statistics in your stories (like "Did you know that playing with toys like cars can improve problem-solving skills by 30%?") even when you just wanted a simple story about a boy playing with his red toy car.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

I've updated the script generation system to be smarter about detecting what type of content you want:

### **Auto-Detection (Default)**
The system now automatically detects when you want:
- **Pure Stories**: "Make me a story about...", "Tell me a tale of...", "Create an adventure about..."
- **Educational Content**: "Explain how...", "Tell me facts about...", "Why does...", "How do..."

### **Updated Prompts**
- **Modified `script_gen.txt`**: Now includes auto-detection and avoids adding facts to stories
- **Created `story_mode.txt`**: Dedicated pure storytelling prompt
- **Added mode configuration**: You can choose your preferred mode

## üéÆ How to Use

### **Option 1: Auto Mode (Recommended)**
Keep the default setting - it will automatically detect what you want:

```python
SCRIPT_GENERATION_MODE = "auto"  # In settings/config.py
```

**Examples:**
- "Make me a story about a boy playing with his red toy car" ‚Üí Pure storytelling
- "Tell me facts about space exploration" ‚Üí Educational with facts
- "Explain how photosynthesis works" ‚Üí Educational content

### **Option 2: Force Story Mode**
If you always want pure storytelling without facts:

```python
SCRIPT_GENERATION_MODE = "story"  # In settings/config.py
```

### **Option 3: Force Educational Mode**
If you always want facts and data:

```python
SCRIPT_GENERATION_MODE = "educational"  # In settings/config.py
```

## üìù Examples

### **Story Mode Output (Your Request):**
```
"Meet Timmy, a 6-year-old boy with a vivid imagination. His red toy car, named 'Rocket', isn't just a toy - it's his spaceship to distant planets. Every afternoon, Timmy transforms his living room into a cosmic adventure. He zooms Rocket through asteroid fields made of couch cushions and lands on alien worlds of carpet patterns. Today, Rocket discovered a new galaxy behind the bookshelf. What adventures await in your imagination? Share your favorite childhood toy below!"
```

**No unwanted facts or statistics!**

### **Educational Mode Output:**
```
"Did you know that playing with toys like cars can improve problem-solving skills by 30%? The average person touches their phone 2,617 times daily. That's once every 33 seconds! Apple's Siri processes 25 billion requests monthly. Your device knows your patterns better than you do. Want to see what your phone knows? Comment 'PHONE' below!"
```

**Includes facts and data as requested.**

## üîß Configuration

### **Change Mode:**
1. Open `settings/config.py`
2. Find `SCRIPT_GENERATION_MODE`
3. Change to your preferred mode:
   - `"auto"` - Auto-detects story vs educational (default)
   - `"story"` - Pure storytelling only
   - `"educational"` - Facts and data only
   - `"mixed"` - Both with auto-detection

### **Test Different Modes:**
```bash
python test_story_modes.py
```

## üéØ Key Improvements

1. **Smart Detection**: Automatically knows when you want a story vs facts
2. **Pure Storytelling**: No more unwanted statistics in stories
3. **Flexible Configuration**: Choose your preferred mode
4. **Better Examples**: Clear examples of story vs educational content
