Did you know that gamers are more likely to have a higher 
self-esteem than non-gamers? A study found that gamers score 
higher on measures of self-confidence and body satisfaction.
[Wall-E animation] Meanwhile, in reality TV shows like 'The 
Real World', gamer dads like Wall-E are redefining masculinity.
You think being a gamer dad is just for kids? Think again! 
Gamers often develop problem-solving skills that translate 
to real life.

## 💡 Why This Matters:

When generating videos, it's crucial to know:
1. **What the narrator will say** (audio script)
2. **What visuals will show** (scene descriptions)

Now both are clearly separated and labeled!

1. Generate script → See narrator script clearly boxed
2. Review what narrator will say → Easy to read
3. Check scene descriptions → Separated below
4. Generate voice → Uses the narrator script
5. Create video → Perfect!
